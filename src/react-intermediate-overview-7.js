// Scaling up with reducer and context 

// Reducers let you consolidate a componentâ€™s state update logic. 
// Context lets you pass information deep down to other components. 
// You can combine reducers and context together to manage state of a complex screen.

// With this approach, a parent component with complex state manages it with a reducer. 
// Other components anywhere deep in the tree can read its state via context. 
// They can also dispatch actions to update that state.
